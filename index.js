//Whatâ€™s the difference between window vs document?

//window
//The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

//The Window interface is home to a variety of functions, namespaces, objects, and constructors which are not necessarily directly associated with the concept of a user interface window.

//document
//The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.

//The Document interface describes the common properties and methods for any kind of document.

//"<h1>Hello </h1>

//Add one style attribute and give text color as red and id attribute and give the id value as ""heading"" in the above given h1 tag using DOM functions"
